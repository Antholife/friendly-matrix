To ensure a positive experience for all contributors and users, we have established the following guidelines:

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Being respectful and considerate of others' viewpoints and experiences.
- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being empathetic and courteous in interactions.

- Any other behavior that may cause discomfort or harm to individuals within the community.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for enforcing these standards. They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that violate this Code of Conduct. Users who engage in unacceptable behavior may be temporarily or permanently banned from interacting within the project community.
